## About

The purpose of this project was to create a simple API with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using only native modules from Node, such as `fs` to write and read files and `http` to create the server and handle requests. No database was used, all the records are stored in a single **.txt** file that is single handed by Node file system module.

## Usage

### **Requirements:**

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) v.20 or higher

If you use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), just run `nvm use` inside of the root folder.

### **Installing:**

Since the project was made using only native modules, there's no need to run `npm i` ou `yarn`, just clone this repository and you're good to go.

### **Starting**

```bash
$ npm start # Project will start at http://localhost:8001/
```
